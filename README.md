# PyroLam
PyroLam is a android application.it is devloped to predict the forest fire with data mining,and Machine learning


<b>Purpose of the system</b>:

Is it going to rain today? Or a sunny day? Are there any chances of a forest fire? or a
tornado? What not! Just a couple of years ago, answering any of those questions required
watching your local news or tuning in to The Weather Channel to get a vague forecast
that will probably change before you get where youâ€™re going. But with smart phones, we
can have insanely accurate weather reporting and predictions at our fingertips everywhere
we go.
So, Pyrolam helps people in knowing the weather conditions related to fire in an area and
take precautions before it occurs.
