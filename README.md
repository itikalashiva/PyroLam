# PyroLam

<b>PYROLAM</b> is an android based application which resides on Fire base google cloud.
Fire base contains server and database. It provides all the basic user options like login,
registration, forgot password. PyroLam also represent the live fire data form NASA.
Live spreading of data is shown on maps using google maps API.
Added features:
<ul>
<li> Simple Layout and efficient.</li>
<li> Provides connectivity with NASA live view.</li>
<li> Analyzes climatic conditions based on user inputs. </li>
</ul>

<b>Purpose of the system</b>:

Is it going to rain today? Or a sunny day? Are there any chances of a forest fire? or a
tornado? What not! Just a couple of years ago, answering any of those questions required
watching your local news or tuning in to The Weather Channel to get a vague forecast
that will probably change before you get where youâ€™re going. But with smart phones, we
can have insanely accurate weather reporting and predictions at our fingertips everywhere
we go.
So, Pyrolam helps people in knowing the weather conditions related to fire in an area and
take precautions before it occurs.

<b>Proposed System:</b>
PyroLam is a fire prediction App,it stores the data and react to the future situations based
on past experiences.
It acts more like human with Data Mining and Machine Learning.
<ul>
<li> It takes its own decisions based on the data provided to it .</li>
<li> The accuracy of the prediction depends upon the correctness of the data.</li>
<li> It uses Firebase which is a combination of server and database. Pyrolam is a real
time application. Therefore it is easy for database storage.</li>

<li> The datasets are taken from NASA satellite data .</li>
<li> The data is mined with iterative dichotomiser 3 algorithm to draw the decision
tree and structure the data.</li>
<li> The mined data is given as an input to a Machine learning algorithm.</li>
<li> The algorithm helps to predict the forest fire based on the 14 attributes.</li>
</ul>
